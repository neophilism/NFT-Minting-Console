> **Owner instruction, 2026-10-13:** Independent human/external security review is deferred and is not a prerequisite for implementation, merge or deployment. AI source/security review and applicable passing tests are the operational review process. Actual defects and missing functionality still require fixes. External review/certification remain honestly pending. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [review policy](../security/review-policy.json). This supersedes conflicting older review-gate wording below.

# NFT Console — Complete Development & Handoff Plan

**Status:** Approved *scope proposal* / implementation plan; individual PRs are not marked complete until verified.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/neophilism/NFT-Minting-Console  
**Authoritative security specification:** https://github.com/neophilism/End-To-End-Everywhere-Security-Architecture-Standard  
**Plan revision:** 2026-10-10, initial baseline.
**Independent handoff companion files:** [Recovered Decisions & Context](HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md) · [Completeness Audit / Blockers](HANDOFF_STATUS.md) · [Frozen Original Contract and Rights](../reference/androids-of-the-vine/). Read these before PR-01; they preserve design constraints from earlier discussions that were not fully described in the 36-PR list.  
**Product name:** **NFT Console**. Never title the product after an individual NFT collection.

## 1. Product contract: what the finished product does

NFT Console is a professional, approachable web application for creating **any number of independent NFT collections/releases** using the user's preferred, custom ERC-721C-compatible *collection contract family*. A release can contain one work, a numbered limited edition of one work, or many distinct media works (images, videos, audio, and other digital files). Each release has its own name, ticker/symbol, max supply, optional series/edition identifiers, royalty recipient and percentage, owner and minter addresses, rights documents, metadata, prices, network, and durable deployment record. The defaults are reusable and editable; **Androids Of The Vine (40 NFTs, AOTV, 6% royalty, 1 ETH initial listing)** is a historical example/preset only, not the schema.

### Definition of done

A nontechnical authorized user can:
1. Sign into a responsive web UI and open their encrypted releases dashboard.
2. Create/edit a private release, enter collection settings and rights, drag/drop multiple works/previews, and review a media grid and edition assignments.
3. Save the draft locally and/or encrypted in the cloud, resume on another authorized device through a documented recovery/key-sharing flow, and see upload/preparation progress and item-level errors.
4. Click **Validate** for automated media, rights, hashes, supply, account, contract, marketplace-policy and chain safety checks, with plain-language findings and actionable repairs.
5. Choose **Test** (local/Sepolia) or **Deploy** (mainnet), understand gas/cost/chain/irreversibility, sign only the necessary on-chain transactions with their wallet or approved Safe flow, and receive durable receipts.
6. Configure and verify the collection's compatible transfer-validator settings through a gated setup wizard; never grant broad validator operator approval or use the compromised Limit Break Payment Processor.
7. Mint one or more NFTs efficiently with a preview of exact immutable on-chain values and post-mint checks.
8. Create, sign, submit and **independently verify** a live OpenSea listing at the selected price and currency; see its true status and link. A minted NFT must never be reported as listed when no valid order exists.
9. See collection inventory, token IDs, deployed policy, listings, transaction history, royalty checks and precise errors; re-list or mint subsequent works under an existing collection without redeploying.
10. Create an entirely different collection later via the same steps, with no project-specific hard coding or manual code edits.

**Non-goals:** custody of private keys, unapproved autonomous financial transactions, bypass of legal/securities requirements, hiding public NFT content from marketplace buyers, guarantees of marketplace royalty enforcement across all transfer methods, or claims of security-standard certification without evidence.

## 2. Mandatory architecture & invariants

- **One deploy per collection, not per NFT.** Contracts are factory-parameterized by collection name/symbol, maximum supply, owner, minter, royalty recipient/rate and applicable rights/hash model. Mint repeated works against the existing address.
- **Preferred custom contract remains the source of truth.** First compare the current repo's generic `NFTCollection.sol` against the last audited 178-line no-autoapproval variant and preserve its tested security semantics. Any divergences, constructor changes or new batching logic must be reviewed and reaudited; do not call the new contract “audited” by inheritance.
- **Immutable creative/economic layer:** each minted token's media hash, rights hash, rights URI, metadata URI, title and defined edition are write-once; enforce explicit max supply/ID uniqueness; no admin seizure; 6% only when chosen (configurable for other releases). Roles may be smart wallets; test Safe and EIP-7702 paths. Rights and purchaser-benefit language must be per-release and reviewed, not an invisible default.
- **Trusted OWNER transfer-policy model, visibly disclosed:** OWNER can maintain marketplace compatibility and can loosen/tighten or inadvertently block transfers. No `AutomaticValidatorTransferApproval`; neither owner nor validator receives holder operator approvals by default. Direct wallet transfers may evade on-chain royalty enforcement; disclose this accurately.
- **Separate modes:** (i) *private workspace* encrypts draft files, rights, thumbnails and sensitive project info before server storage; (ii) *explicit publish* uploads selected plaintext media, metadata and public rights to public content-addressed storage, with warning and irreversible consent. Never claim public IPFS assets are E2EE. Do not include secrets, investor information or personal Circle registry details in public NFT metadata.
- **E2EESA exact version/profile pinned and scoped.** Profile applicability is based on components/data flows, not repository names; requirements are resolved and accompanied by evidence. No conformance/certification claim until production scope and external verification satisfy upstream rules. The upstream standard is under active pre-1.0 development.
- **Cryptography and key boundaries:** use a version-pinned E2EESA attachment encryption profile (fresh per-file 256-bit keys, authenticated chunk encryption, authenticated manifest, unique nonces); cryptographic randomness; ciphertext-only server storage; key derivation/wrapping, authorized multi-device transfer, revocation limits and recovery have explicit designs. Server never learns draft encryption keys or unencrypted drafts. Wallet signatures **authenticate** separately; they are not automatically E2EE encryption keys. Public rendering of client-supplied plaintext while preparing publication occurs on the trusted client.
- **Web execution trust:** normal hosted web apps trust the code-serving origin. Select/document the honest E2EESA browser security profile and release-integrity controls; stronger independently verified bootstrap can be a later extension. CSP/TLS/SRI do not magically remove malicious-origin risk.
- **Server/admin boundaries:** wallet-based auth with nonce/domain/chain/expiry/replay protection and SIWE-equivalent validated format; approved Safe authentication strategy; RBAC; CSRF/session hardening; upload size/mime checks, quotas, rate limits and budget controls; pinning keys/OpenSea keys server-side; no raw signing keys stored; encrypted storage and backups.
- **Publication/chain invariants:** preflight the exact chain ID, deployed bytecode and known contract version, roles, supply, validator status, minting closure, token availability, token hash/URI/rights values, gas, IPFS retrieval and marketplace authorizer before asking for signatures. Fail closed on mismatch. Record receipts and recover from interrupted workflows idempotently.
- **Chain/environment support:** Ethereum mainnet canonical; Sepolia for rehearsal; other EVM chains only after audited compatibility and marketplace support checks. No “one-click” promise implying no signature or fees.
- **No release bypass:** CI checks, dependency pinning, SAST, secrets scan, contract static tests/integration/adversarial tests, signed build provenance, vulnerability triage, manual security review, disposable mainnet real-sale rehearsal and rollout rollback/stop controls precede production launch.

## 3. Technology choices and controls

- Web: accessible responsive TypeScript React application with persistent release wizard, media previews, upload queue, status timeline, wallet connection and clear signing flow.
- Backend: TypeScript service handling authenticated session, job orchestration, IPFS pinning, OpenSea API proxy, indexing receipts, status reconciliation and structured redacted logs. Never holds plaintext private drafts.
- Data: Postgres (Neon eligible) for metadata/operations with envelope-encrypted values where needed; encrypted object storage for draft blobs, public IPFS for only confirmed published content. Use explicit retention/deletion policies.
- Ethereum: ABI/bytecode built from pinned contract toolchain; viem or ethers wallet adapters with Safe support; deterministic deployment records/config profiles; compare executable bytecode/codehash before writes.
- Marketplace: OpenSea current supported listing-action endpoint or maintained SDK; seller reviews the precise approvals, Seaport zone, royalty consideration, price/currency, expiration and fee recipients; signs through wallet. Verify via API **and** relevant on-chain state rather than assuming API receipt equals a live listing.
- Security: standards manifest (exact upstream release/commit and selected E2EESA profiles), machine-readable application-to-standard requirement crosswalk, threat model, conformance evidence, automated adversarial fixtures.
- Ops: GitHub Actions required branch checks, Render web/API deployment, Neon database, managed object storage/IPFS service, alerts, logs, backups, runbooks, and Engine Room progress integration.

**Implementation decisions deliberately reserved for PRs 04, 08 and 10:** crypto-library/profile selection, cross-device key recovery design, and verified-browser client trust profile. Must be selected by evidence against the pinned E2EESA source, not invented algorithm parameters.

## 4. Execution plan — complete ordered PR backlog

All numbered PRs below are planned **work packages**, not already-created pull requests. Implementation can chain independent PRs; the base prerequisites and acceptance gates must stay intact. Each PR must update relevant documentation/tests. A PR is **complete** only after tests, review and merge; a feature is **production-ready** only after its applicable implementation, test and operational checks; external human review is deferred.

### Foundation and audited-contract parity

**PR-01 — Repository baseline and project charter.** Verify currently committed files, remove inconsistent AOTV product labels and obsolete instructions, describe generic release vs token model, define supported chains, feature lifecycle and single authoritative plan. **Depends:** none. **Acceptance:** links/data model/use cases agreed, no project-specific constants outside examples.

## 5. Parallel sequencing and release gates

**Stream A — contract/security:** 01→02→03→04→05→06→21→22→23→24→25→26→27→28→29→30→31→33→34.  
**Stream B — encrypted platform/data:** 01→07→08→09→10→11→12→13→14.  
**Stream C — UI:** 01→07→15→16→17→18→19→20, then 28–29.  
**Stream D — operations:** 02→31→32→33→34→35→36.  

The streams may run concurrently, but **do not deploy production until contract parity, real-validator, client E2EE, publish-boundary, AI security review, disposable-mainnet sale/royalty, recovery, and CI gates are all green.**

Milestones:
- **M1 — documented baseline:** PR 01–08. No production claim.
- **M2 — functional private beta:** PR 09–20. Encrypted drafts and intuitive release builder.
- **M3 — end-to-end testnet:** PR 21–25. Signed deploy/mint and readback.
- **M4 — marketplace integration:** PR 26–29. Verified listing under real marketplace.
- **M5 — trusted production:** PR 30–36. Audit, operational/security evidence, rehearsed production and handoff.

## 6. PR execution rules

- Every PR gets: purpose, exact affected components, prerequisites, threat/security implications, diff, tests, acceptance evidence, screenshots for UI, deployment/recovery impact and current blockers.
- Chain nonconflicting PRs automatically when tests/review are green; do not silently merge red tests or expand scope.
- Security-sensitive PRs require a substantive AI-assisted security review and E2EESA crosswalk updates.
- Failures are fixed, not waived for launch. Material product/legal choices are escalated; implementation decisions follow best practice and this plan.
- “Feature implemented,” “tests passed,” “deployed,” “active listing,” “royalty settled” and “security conformance” are **distinct statuses** backed by separate evidence.
- Never store wallet seeds, private keys, E2EE content keys or privileged service secrets in GitHub, public IPFS or browser-accessible configuration.

## 7. Existing code status (must not be mistaken for done)

At plan writing the repository already contains an early generic Solidity contract, simple HTML/CSS/JS front end, express server, wallet sign-in, Pinata upload route, basic preflight, batch mint interactions and an initial CI workflow. **This is an unverified prototype**, not the finished secure console. It has not established contract parity with the last reviewed package, audited generic changes, genuinely private E2EE drafts, robust administrative role management, persisted multi-release orchestration, polished design, complete validator setup, Safe flows, automatic OpenSea listing, full testnet/mainnet rehearsal, or production deployment.

PR 02 must validate the current CI after the latest fixes; past initial runs failed due Node setup expecting a missing lockfile. PR 03 must independently establish actual Solidity compilation and original-contract parity before anyone signs a production deployment. PR 08–13 supersede the existing server-side plaintext upload architecture for private drafts; publishing must be redesigned with user-approved client declassification. Do **not** publish secrets or sensitive private media through the prototype.

## 8. Inputs needed eventually (not needed to develop code)

At launch, authorized wallet(s)/Safe signatures, verified chain network, hosting domain, funded gas wallet, hosted database and storage/IPFS credentials, and an OpenSea API key/appropriate signing session. User should provide credentials only to their providers' secret managers—never in chat, repo, a web form without a secure secret-management flow, or public artifacts.

The initial specific collection(s) to mint, sale price, rights agreement and artwork are per-release user content, **not compile-time application configuration**. Reusable defaults may be saved privately.

## 9. Objective acceptance walkthrough (final end-to-end)

A fresh user account opens the live app and creates **“Release Alpha”**, 3 image NFTs at 0.05 ETH, 4% royalty, its own rights. They upload three images, privately save/resume the draft, inspect hashes, publish selected content, sign one generic contract deployment, configure validator, mint IDs 1–3 with a batch signature and see three verified OpenSea listings with correct prices and royalty settings. Then they create **“Release Beta”**, 50 video editions (poster files, 6% royalty, 1 ETH price), deploy its independent collection and batch-mint the first 10. Later they resume and mint editions 11–20 **without redeploying Beta**. A different authorized device cannot open either private draft until key authorization/recovery. A secondary buyer sees only the intentionally published NFT assets and rights, not private drafts or admin records.

**Completion is based on these observable operations and security evidence, not on PR count alone.**
